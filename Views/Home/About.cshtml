            <b>Who am I?</b>
            I was born in 1991. My hometown is Suvagil village of Zagatala district, which is one of the most beautiful places of Azerbaijan. I got there in the secondary school in 1996-2008. During 2008-2012 years I studied "Information Technologies and Software" specialty at Azerbaijan Technical University. In the summer of 2012 until the summer of 2013, I was in the military service. Since February 2014, I work as Software Developer for an IT company in Baku/Azerbaijan.

            <b>Technologies I use.</b>
            I love work on web projects and .Net technologies are my favourites. In addition, when desktop applications needed, I work with them willingly. In my works I use Sql Server and Oracle databases related with C# and Asp.Net. On the client side, JavaScript & Jquery are my favourites. CSS3 and Bootstrap framework help me for coding webdesign.

            It seems that my articles will be based mostly web development.
